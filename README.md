# Client Server Image Viewer
Developed a JavaScript-based client-server remote image viewer. The server is configured to serve images to clients for direct display using the default image viewer supported by their operating system. This tool is essential for visualizing the effects of various peer-to-peer network protocols throughout the term. Upon completion, a correctly implemented code will successfully display a recognizable image on the client, providing direct feedback on its functionality. Incomplete or incorrectly written codes may not achieve this outcome, highlighting the importance of thorough implementation and understanding of the project requirements.
